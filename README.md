Simple Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

What is PSO technique?
In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best-known position but is also guided toward the best-known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.
My Thought About This Algorithm:
Normally, this algorithm should have been more effective, but I think from my errors of source code, it only showed one solution. It looks like 20 particles, so it makes the solution closer to global minima.
